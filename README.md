# PrimeNumbers
Ever wondered what the prime numbers are between two values? Now you're in luck!

To use the files uploaded for this project you will need either a Python interpreter or Jupyter notebooks installed on your machine.
If you would like to use a Python interpreter then download the 'Primes.py' file from the repository and then head on over to this website https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the latest version of Python for your machine. Open the downloaded .py file through the included IDLE and have fun finding all the primes!
If you would like to use Jupyter notebooks then download the 'Primes.ipynb' file from the repository and head over to this website https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution and download Anaconda distribution. Once this is installed launch the 'Anaconda navigator' and inside you will see a program called 'Notebook' launch this and Jupyter notebook will open in your browser. Once here upload the 'Primes.ipynb' to the 'files' tab and double click on it to run it.
